This folder should contain images referenced by the project README.

Place the following files here (recommended names):

- `banner.jpg` — optional banner image shown at the top of `README.md`.
- `latency_comparison.jpg` — side-by-side latency comparison (node vs ffplay).
- `rviz_qos.png` — screenshot showing where to change Image Reliability to "Best Effort" in RViz.

Tips

- Use web-friendly sizes (e.g., width ≤ 1200px). Prefer JPEG or PNG.
- Add the images to Git or LFS if they are large.
